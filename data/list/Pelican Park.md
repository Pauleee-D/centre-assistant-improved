## 5.Boosts Immune Function

- ·It helps reduce inflammation and supports immune system regulation, which is essentialforhealinganddiseaseprevention

## COMPRESSION BOOTS

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use compression boots, including how to put them on, take them off, how long to use them, and their benefits:

## 2. Putting on the Boots

- Unzip or open the boots fully.
- ·Slide your legs in, ensuring your feet are snug at the bottom.
- Align the boots properly so the compression zones match your calves, knees, and thighs.
- ·Zip or fasten the boots securely but not too tight—-comfort is key.

## 3.Duration of Use

- ·Beginner: Start with 15-20 minutes.
- ·Regular Use: 30-45 minutes per session.
- ·Maximum: Up to 60 minutes, depending on your recovery needs and manufacturer guidelines.

## 4. Adjusting Settings

- ·Use the control unit to:
- ·Select compression intensity (low, medium, high).
- ·Choose massage mode (sequential, pulse, wave, etc.).
- ·Set session duration.

Start with low to medium pressure if you're new, and increase gradually based on comfort.

## 5. During the Session
