Our memberships start from $44 a week, giving you access to our: Recovery Centre� Aquatics facilities, including our 25m and hydrotherapy pool� Gym & Health Club� Lockers� What is the benefit of each service? Infrared Saunas assist in relieving inflammation, stiffness and soreness by increasing blood circulation and heart rate Normatec Compression Boots aid in recovery by increasing circulation and enhancing lymphatic drainage leading to an increased range of motion and flexibility. Ice baths use reduces the risk of injury and muscle damage from exercise by constricting blood vessels and decreasing metabolic activity. The process speeds up recovery making you better prepared for your next workout allowing you to perform more effectively Hyperice Massage Guns will deliver a massage experience whereby the user can pinpoint the areas of their body that require attention to apply a specific amount of pressure through the gun that will release tension and increase muscle metabolism.What do I need to bring and what do I wear? For all sessions we require patrons to bring a towel and drink bottle to use throughout their time in the recovery space. If you are completing an infrared sauna or ice bath session it is a requirement to wear your bathers in the same way you would in a swimming pool. When using the Normatec compression boots it is a requirement to wear full length pants/leggings underneath the boots. Massage guns can be used through clothing so there are no extra requirements when using these. How long do sessions go for? Each booking is for 45 minutes which includes a quick set up and pack up component to ensure you get the most out of your session.What is the minimum age for use of the Recovery Sessions? Minimum age for use of ice baths and infrared sauna is 16 years of age. Exceptions may apply upon presentation of advice from medical practitioner or allied health professional. Minimum age of use for Hyperice Massage technology and Normatec compression technology is 13 years of age.MEMBERS MUST BOOK IN RECOVERY VIA THE TECHNOGYM -TRAINING COACH APPRecovery Centre* Saturday, October 28, 2023 7:28 PM
