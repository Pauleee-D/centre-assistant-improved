Memberships are now available for purchase as well as casual recovery session bookings. Our memberships start from $44 a week, giving you access to our: Recovery Centre• Aquatics facilities, including our 25m and hydrotherapy pool• Gym & Health Club• Lockers• What is the benefit of each service? Infrared Saunas assist in relieving inflammation, stiffness and soreness by increasing blood circulation and heart rate Normatec Compression Boots aid in recovery by increasing circulation and enhancing lymphatic drainage leading to an increased range of motion and flexibility. Ice baths use reduces the risk of injury and muscle damage from exercise by constricting blood vessels and decreasing metabolic activity. The process speeds up recovery making you better prepared for your next workout allowing you to perform more effectively Hyperice Massage Guns will deliver a massage experience whereby the user can pinpoint the areas of their body that require attention to apply a specific amount of pressure through the gun that will release tension and increase muscle metabolism. What do I need to bring and what do I wear? For all sessions we require patrons to bring a towel and drink bottle to use throughout their time in the recovery space. If you are completing an infrared sauna or ice bath session it is a requirement to wear your bathers in the same way you would in a swimming pool. When using the Normatec compression boots it is a requirement to wear full length pants/leggings underneath the boots. Massage guns can be used through clothing so there are no extra requirements when using these. How long do sessions go for? Each booking is for 45 minutes which includes a quick set up and pack up component to ensure you get the most out of your session. What is the minimum age for use of the Recovery Sessions? Minimum age for use of ice baths and infrared sauna is 16 years of age. Exceptions may apply upon presentation of advice from medical practitioner or allied health professional. Minimum age of use for Hyperice Massage technology and Normatec compression technology is 13 years of age.

### Membership Prices and Options
East Fremantle Membership: The EP membership includes the same Exercise Physiology sessions as individual appointments, but it’s set up as an ongoing program through weekly or fortnightly direct debit. It’s designed for members who need regular, ongoing support rather than one-off sessions. Because it’s a bundled membership, sessions generally can’t be claimed through Medicare, private health, or WorkCover — those rebates usually apply only to individually paid sessions. Members are welcome to check directly with their fund to see if any coverage applies, but in most cases it does not. One condition of this membership is a minimum four-week commitment before switching to another membership type, which helps cover the initial assessment and program setup cost.

Effective July 1 2024, we will be permanently closing our childcare facilities at Knox Leisureworks. This decision has not been made lightly where careful analysis around where the leisure industry is and the rising costs associated in operating sessional childcare. The following communications will go to 37 families that have utilised the childcare in 2024 at 9:30am this morning. Please refrain from mentioning the closure before then and if any media enquiries contact Knox Leisureworks for comment, please advise "no comment" and to grab their details and send to me, for correct response from our media response team. Subject: Changes in Child Care Services at Knox Leisureworks. Dear (member name), We wish to inform our members and community members that from July 1 2024 we will be closing our Child Care services at Knox Leisureworks. This has been a difficult decision that we have have delayed as long as possible. We understand this will impact some of the families in our community, particularly on those parents and guardians who rely on Knox Leisureworks child care as part of their health & wellbeing activities. However, despite our best efforts to sustain and retain these services, we have faced changes in the industry and increasing challenges to fund the service that have led to the conclusion that continuing the childcare is no longer feasible. Effective July 1 2024, the childcare services at Knox Leisureworks will cease operations permanently. We are committed to assisting our members during this transition period and will provide information regarding alternative childcare options in the local area. We remain dedicated to providing the best possible services in all areas of Knox Leisureworks and look forward to continuing to serve you in those capacities. Kind Regards, Knox Leisureworks FAQ's - Will my membership get cheaper? Platinum memberships will be reduced in price effective July 1. Since November 2022, new members have not received child care as a part of their membership benefits. As of 01/07/2024 childcare is no longer available Childcare Tuesday, December 20, 2022 5:03 PM Hoist is available for the warm water pool. Wheel chair access Tuesday, November 04, 2025 2:28 PM

In saying this, that would be the equivalent to running a marathon so from a health and safety approach someone should slowly build up to that time, depth and temp in training the body. A beginner should look to start with lower body and for short amount of time. Your skin needs to adapt its skin receptors to the cold water, consistency with the ice bath make it easier for your skin and reduce the "shock" factor.

However please don’t say we can take on a tour as we don’t have that resource on hand without a booking.

### Membership Prices and Options
WaterMarc Membership: What is Reformer Pilates? Reformer Pilates is a full-body workout designed to enhance strength, coordination, and mobility using a machine with adjustable springs for resistance. The workout focuses on slow, controlled movements with an emphasis on core activation and proper alignment. Classes incorporate a mix of static and dynamic exercises, which can vary from low intensity to more athletic movements. A key advantage of Reformer Pilates is its low-impact nature, making it gentle on the joints while still providing an effective and challenging workout. The adjustable resistance helps tone muscles, improve posture, increase flexibility, and build core strength. Please note that Reformer Pilates may not be suitable for individuals who are injured or recovering from an injury, unless prior approval has been given by an instructor or medical professional. Whether your goal is to increase strength, recover under professional guidance, or improve overall fitness, Reformer Pilates offers a versatile and effective solution. We do not offer trials for reformer Pilates classes and there’s no concession rate. There will be 13 reformer beds. Does Fitness Passport include Reformer Pilates?• > Fitness passport members will not have access to Reformer Pilates classes as it's a premium WaterMarc membership. They have 2 options for this: pay casually $43.90 a class or purchase/upgrade to a premium membership with WaterMarc for $43.90 per week. Will these reformer pilates classes be pregnancy safe?• > We have a pre and postnatal class that runs once per week which they can join.
