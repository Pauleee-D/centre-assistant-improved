As Bundaberg Aquatic Centre nears completion, Bundaberg Regional Council is inviting the community to book a free venue tour on Monday, the 17th of November. This is your chance to get a sneak peak of your incredible new aquatic centre!

Tours will run for 30-minute sessions, between 9am and 4pm. This will be enough time to view the whole facility and see firsthand how it will transform swimming, training and recreation in the Bundaberg region.

Bundaberg Region Mayor, Helen Blackburn, says she hopes the tours can build community excitement as the final touches are put on the site’s construction.

“This project has been years in the making and Council and the Councillors are incredibly proud to be opening the doors for our community to see what’s been achieved,” she said. “These tours are a fantastic opportunity to see the facilities up close before the official opening.”

For everyone’s safety and enjoyment, tours will accommodate no more than 30 people per tour group. With limited spaces, we encourage residents to secure their spots as soon as possible.

For those unable to attend in person, Bundaberg Regional Council will be releasing an online video tour, giving the entire community the chance to share in the anticipation and explore the new facility from wherever they are.

Please note:

  * All participants must wear closed-toe shoes.
  * Tours will not allow for swimming, however lifeguards will be on duty for visitors safety.



Book your tour via the link below.

### Benefits of Reformer Pilates

**Improve Core Strength**

Reformer Pilates focuses heavily on engaging the core muscles, including abdominals, lower back and pelvic floor. Strengthening these muscles improves posture, stability and overall functional movement.

**Enhance Flexibility**

Regular practice on the reformer helps improve both static and dynamic flexibility. The machine allows for controlled stretching and lengthening of muscles, promoting joint mobility and reducing stiffness.

**Better Posture**

Through targeted exercises, Reformer Pilates helps align the spine and strengthen postural muscles. This results in improved posture, which can alleviate back, neck and shoulder pain often caused by poor alignment. 

**Strengthen and Tone Muscles**

The resistance provided by the reformer machine allows for a full-body workout that targets all major muscle groups. It leads to increased muscle tone, strength and endurance – especially in the legs, arms and core.

**Low Impact Workout**

Unlike high-impact exercise, Reformer Pilates provides a low-impact workout that reduces stress on the joints while effectively strengthening and toning muscles. This makes it suitable for people with joint issues or those recovering from injury.

**Improve Balance and Coordination**

The reformer machine encourages controlled movements that challenge your balance and awareness for self. This helps improve coordination, stability and overall movement efficiency.

**Injury Rehab and Prevention**

Reformer Pilates is often used for rehabilitation because it strengthens muscles in a safe and controlled manner, helping to prevent future injuries. The equipment can also be adapted for a range of abilities and injury concerns.

**Practice Mindfulness**

Reformer Pilates encourages us to slow down, concentrate on our breath and move fluidly through positions. This practice reduces stress and encourages us to find calm and mental clarity.
