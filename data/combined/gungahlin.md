## What are the benefits of Reformer Pilates:

Reformer Pilates encompasses many benefits that improve not only your physical fitness, but also your mental wellbeing. Here are some of the most pivotal reasons why Reformer Pilates is beneficial to everyone: 

  1. ### Full Body Workout 

The broad functionality of the reformer machine enables a workout that can target specific, individualized movements, which stimulates you for a full body workout. The subtlety of the springs in the reformer also strengthens your entire body, making it a well rounded workout for all exercisers. 

  2. ### Builds strength and tones muscle 

This energizing form of exercise manipulates the use of the machine’s springs and levers to enforce resistance and promotes equal focus on the concentric and eccentric contractions to create long, lean and toned muscles. This thorough workout stimulates not just all big muscle groups, but also muscle mass that is typically overshadowed. 

  3. ### Low Impact (but high intensity) 

If you have recently suffered from an injury, professionally aided Reformer Pilates classes are an ideal way to accelerate your recovery. The ingenius design of the reformer machine caters to horizontal plane exercise rather than weight bearing, which reduces the load on your body. The gentle impact, and repetitive movements which occur tones your muscle and speeds up the recovery process. 

  4. ### Improves core and posture 

Reformer Pilates target the core of your body, while simultaneously working the peripheral postural muscles. Exercising the core region of your body is key to improving posture. 

  5. ### Improves Mental Health 

In addition to all the fantastic physical benefits that result from the use of Reformer Pilates sessions, this variety of exercise is also highly beneficial to your mental health and wellbeing. The sessions focus on the steadiness of breath to centre mindfulness in movement, stress management and relaxation. In doing so, Reformer Pilates can reduce stress hormones such as cortisol, and increase endorphins, generating an experience designed to prioritize mental wellbeing into your workout.
