Tuesday,July 22,2025 8:41AM

## 18/7DebitSuccess/PriceIncrease

From: Gulsen Krastic

Hey Team, Debit Success have sent an email out to all members this morning about the price increase, which explains why we are experiencing an influx of calls and enquiries (and you may experience the same). Just as a heads up, please let them know the message they received from Debit Success is simply to inform them of the upcoming price increase for the new financial year. If they are on suspension, assure them their membership will remain on hold, and no payments will be processed whilst the suspension is in place.

However, once their membership resumes, payments will reflect the updated pricing members on 4 July to notify the increase.Thank you.
