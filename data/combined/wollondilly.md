Many families across Australia are currently feeling the pinch thanks to the rising cost of living, and quite often it’s the kids’ extracurricular activities that get put on hold or cancelled first when families are looking for ways to cut spending.

However, at Belgravia Leisure, we are passionate about ensuring water safety is considered an essential activity for kids. Swimming lessons play a vital role in familiarising the swimmer with the water, and for children especially, is crucial in keeping them safe.

“We need to change our outlook on swimming and water safety lessons from being an optional activity to one that is an essential life skill,” says Belgravia Aquatic Services Manager, Sarah Podesta.

It’s especially important to keep up swimming lessons over winter so kids are not losing their skills and that we don’t get complacent around the water. Last year, there were 339 deaths across the country due to drowning, according to Royal Life Saving Australia. A further 686 people experienced a non-fatal drowning incident.

Having strong swimming skills is one way to reduce the risks of drowning.

“We are hearing more and more from parents who are taking their kids out of lessons for financial reasons, and whilst we understand that this is necessary for some, we are urging parents, wherever possible, to make the right choice and keep their little ones in swimming and water safety lessons – you never know, it could one day save their life”.

When children drop their lessons, they need to play catch-up later in the year; another factor to consider.

“They will therefore be less likely to achieve the National Benchmarks in Swimming and Water Safety,” says Sarah. “Keeping up those lessons will mean they will be more confident to enjoy all of Australia’s waterways this summer and have the best chance of being safe all year round”.

Skip to content

In response to Royal Life Saving’s recently released [data](https://www.royallifesaving.com.au/about/news-and-updates/news/2025/mar/decline-in-swimming-skills-puts-lives-at-risk) that shows lifesaving skills of high school students are not up to standard, Wollondilly Community Leisure Centre and Belgravia Leisure are urging families to act by enrolling teens with weak swimming skills in a learn to swim program. 

In response to this skill gap, we are offering a select number of students a **$100 Kickstart to Swim Sponsorship** to help families get their teen started in a GOswim Teen Program. 

According to Royal Life Saving Australia, teachers estimate a staggering **84% of 15-16-year-olds** are unable to swim 400 metres and tread water for five minutes, a basic lifesaving requirement and the benchmark for 17-year-olds. 

The GOswim Teen Program offers a tailored learn to swim program for students aged between 13 and 17 years of age. The course, which meets national benchmarks for RLSSA, includes water safety and survival skills to reduce incidents in open water environments when teens are with their peers and possibly without supervision. 

There are currently almost 800 teenagers across Australia who are currently learning how to swim in a GOswim Teen Program. 

Dr Justin Scarr, RLSS Australia CEO is shocked at the worrying data reflecting the lack of teenager’s swimming skills. 

_“Our report on declining children’s swimming skills is a wakeup call. I was shocked to learn that 39% of year 10 students can’t reach the primary school benchmark – swim 50m and float for 2 minutes. Poor swimming skills put them at significant risk of missing out on the many benefits that being able to swim affords, making them highly vulnerable to drowning as young adults._

_“It’s alarming to see so many children missing out. We risk creating a generation with extremely poor swimming skills. Coordinated investments are needed to boost the swimming and lifesaving skills of children and young people, especially those aged 10-14 years who can’t yet swim 50 metres, before it’s too late,_ ” concluded Dr Scarr. 

Cheryl McLennan, Belgravia Leisure Aquatics Specialist, highlights the importance of engaging teens in innovative ways. 

_“Traditional swimming programs have focused on younger children, but with rising drowning rates among teens and young adults, we need to rethink our approach. The GOswim Teen program not only builds competency in the water but also opens doors to potential aquatic careers as lifeguards or swim teachers._

_“With drowning statistics on the rise, now is the time to prioritise swimming education for teens. The GOswim Teen Program is more than just a lesson—it’s a lifesaving opportunity”,_ concluded Ms McLennan. 

To make the most of this limited time offer and empower your teen with the skills they need to stay safe in the water, register your interest at [$100 Kickstart towards Teen GOswim Lessons](https://belgravialeisure.com.au/teen-kickstart/).
