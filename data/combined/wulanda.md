Wulanda, meaning ‘enjoy or cherish’ in Bunganditj language, is a gathering place for all to participate in sports, recreation, community activities and events.

A new aquatic centre with a 25-metre lap pool, learn-to-swim pool, warm water program pool, and children’s splash pad has been built, and the existing 50m outdoor pool has been updated. In addition, six multi-purpose courts, change rooms and amenities, a gym and allied services provide ample opportunity to participate in sports and recreation.

Whether it is basketball, netball, futsal, volleyball, tennis, roller skating, badminton, or dance, this is the place to be. The health club will provide opportunities for all ages to maintain fitness, create social connections, and increase general wellness.

More than 1,000 people can attend conferences, events, and performances making Wulanda Recreation and Convention Centre the hub of community leisure activities in Mount Gambier.

Wulanda has something for the whole family to enjoy, whether it be a leisurely day around one of our three heated swimming pools or enjoying coffee with lunch at the Café after your workout. We look forward to offering you the best health and leisure experience possible.
