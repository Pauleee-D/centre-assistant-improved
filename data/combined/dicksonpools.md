Skip to content

**Canberra, Dec 16****th****, 2025** : Guests and fans alike at four ACT aquatic venues have been treated to a special visit from none other than Bondi Rescue lifeguard Bruce ‘Hoppo’ Hopkins as he shared an important water safety message to locals ahead of summer. 

Hoppo has again teamed up with Australia’s leading swim school, GOswim, to lead one of the nation’s biggest water safety campaigns. Building on last year’s award-winning success, the Float to Survive with GOswim campaign teaches Australians the essential skills to stay afloat in an emergency. 

Fans came in droves to meet Hoppo in droves across the weekend at Gungahlin Leisure Centre, Dickson Leisure Centre, Lakeside Leisure Centre and Stromlo Leisure Centre, where he demonstrated his five-step survival technique, reinforcing that drowning can happen to anyone, regardless of their swimming ability. 

The campaign responds to new data from Royal Life Saving Australia and Surf Life Saving Australia, revealing that in the past year, 43% of all drownings in the ACT occurred in rivers and creeks, with the highest number of drowning deaths occurring between the ages of 0-4 (15%) and 18-24 (15%). 

Hoppo’s ACT visit wrapped up his national tour which has made waves across the country by equipping 60,000 GOswim students with the skills to stay afloat in emergency aquatic situations and inform many more of the need to have this essential skill. 

“I’m stoked to have partnered with GOswim to reach tens of thousands of students with this lifesaving message, which is relevant to anyone, in any aquatic situation; whether it is in the surf, creek, river, lake or swimming pool,” Hoppo commented. 

“Especially now that we are well into summer, this is a water safety skill that is non-negotiable, and I’m thrilled to have been able to get out and about across the country to spread this message to help Aussies learn how to stay safe in the water.” 

Bernice Hay, Area Manager, ACT says the campaign’s message was warmly welcomed across Canberra. 

“It was important that we worked with Hoppo to take this message to our Canberra aquatic centres to engage directly with communities and reinforce the importance of floating as a survival skill,” Bernice said. 

“While it’s disheartening to see the national drowning statistics heading in the wrong direction, it gives us all a lot of comfort that this campaign has reached so many people in the ACT, giving them the knowledge and skills that might one day save their life in an aquatic emergency. 

“We are also very aware that a big responsibility to spread this message lies with our swim teachers across the ACT, so it was great that they got so involved. 

“I’m proud that Float to Survive with GOswim is diving into this challenge to help the next generation be better prepared for aquatic emergencies, and I can’t wait to share further news on just how much of an impact this campaign has had,” Bernice concluded. 

The campaign also integrated practical training into GOswim lessons nationwide. For the first two weeks of December, more than 250,000 GOswim lessons across nearly 80 locations began with five minutes of float training, based on Hoppo’s five-step Float to Survive strategy: 

  1. Keep your head and mouth above water 


  2. Control your breathing 


  3. Spread your arms and legs for balance 


  4. Use a circular motion to maintain buoyancy 


  5. Signal for help 



The campaign was recently recognised by the Australian Swim Schools Association (ASSA), winning Gold for Marketing and Communications in Victoria and earning national commendation for boosting children’s water safety knowledge and confidence in open water by 20%. 

GOswim is one of Australia’s leading swimming programs, delivering more than 2.8 million lessons annually to over 62,500 members.

With countless safety hazards present at coastal beach settings, and with beaches and pools crowded in popularity over the warmer months, it is vital that all swimmers and supervisors have adequate understanding of water safety rules and advice specific to these environments. This knowledge could be the lifesaving factor if you find yourself in a tricky situation, and could prevent injuries, other medical emergencies and drownings.  
  
Australia experienced a fatal drowning rate of 323 people between the beginning of July 2023 and end of June 2024 according to Royal Life Saving Australia. Almost half (41%) of these occurred during the summer months. The beach was the second most common environment where drownings occurred, accountable for 26%, whilst swimming pools were associated with 12% of drownings. This highlights the continued need for education of, and attention to, water safety around these settings. 

Equip yourself with the following key points for water safety at the pool and beach. It is one thing to know your water safety rules and strategies, but another to practice them – and it’s the practicing that could save a life. 

Top water safety tips for both the pool and beach settings: 

  * Never swim alone, always swim with someone else 
  * Read and obey the safety signs or lifeguard and surf life saver instructions 
  * Ensure adequate active adult supervision of children and weak or non-swimmers. Visit our Aquatic Supervision webpage for more information. 
  * Speak to a lifeguard if you are unsure of the safety hazards and conditions 
  * Avoid swimming after alcohol consumption 



Practice water safety at the beach: 

  * Swim at patrolled beaches, between the red and yellow flags 
  * Check the weather and beach conditions and try to avoid any hazards or dangers 
  * Do not enter the water if there is any doubt of safety 
  * Wear a bright coloured swimsuit or rashie that is easy to see 
  * Decide on an easy to find meeting point if you get lost or separated from your children or friends 



Practice water safety at swimming pools: 

  * Please remember to walk by the poolside, rather than run 
  * Tell a staff member if you are a weak swimmer or non-swimmer, so they can provide you with a special safety wristband for easy identification 
  * Take your time entering the swimming pool 
  * Raise your hand and call for help if you are struggling to swim 



This summer, remember to play it safe and pay attention to water safety hazards as you enjoy aquatic activities with friends and family. Together, we can help to reduce the rate of drownings in Australia and ensure everyone enjoys a happy and whole summer.

With swimming activities on the rise and the summer heat set to soar, we want to ensure that everyone enjoys a safe and positive swimming experience to stay cool and beat the heat. This summer, be sure to practice adequate aquatic supervision and help us to create a safe and respectful swimming environment for everyone. 

We want to work with you to support a safe summer for you, and for us. To achieve this, we would like to remind you of two important messages. 

  1. **Adults supervise, lifeguards save lives**



All children and weak or non-swimmers should have constant adult supervision from parents or carers when in and around water. Active adult supervision means having eyes on the children or persons in your care at all times whilst swimming in and around water. This also means removing or ignoring distractions such as digital devices including mobile phones, and minimising discussion with others, which could cause a lapse in supervision. 

While we do have lifeguards prepared for extreme circumstances, it is important that parents and guardians are fully aware of what their children are doing at all times. Visit our [Aquatic Supervision](https://www.wendenpool.com.au/swim/aquatic-supervision) webpage for more information on how you can actively supervise. 

  2. **All team members deserve respect – we have zero tolerance of anti-social behaviour**



This summer, please remember to be respectful and polite to our members, guests and staff so that everyone can enjoy a safe and happy season. We understand that the summer heat and busyness can have us feeling flustered and bothered, however, we want everyone to be able to enjoy our facilities. If you find yourself feeling frustrated or upset whilst at our centre, please let us know in a calm and respectful manner, and our teams will work to resolve your issue as we want you to enjoy your experience to the fullest. 

If you require mental health support or guidance, please consider contacting a support person or Beyond Blue. Beyond Blue offer 24/7 counselling support via phone or online chat, to support you no matter how you are feeling. To speak to Beyond Blue, you can call 1300 22 4636, or visit their [Webchat Support Service](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/support-service/chat) webpage. 

So, grab your bathers and towel this summer and head to the pool, remembering to actively supervise and keep your cool so we can all enjoy a splashing good time in the pool!
