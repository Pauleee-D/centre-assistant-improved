# Access and Inclusion

## Access and Inclusion

Our centre prides itself on providing aquatic programs to suit our diverse community. Providing opportunities to people with disabilities as well as people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.  
  
Access and Inclusion swimming lessons are based on the GOswim program that promotes water safety and personal development. In addition to assisting in transitioning students into our more mainstream aquatic classes.

## Access and Inclusion Services

Classes are designed to work with each student’s ability, not their disability. We intentionally provide aquatic programs to help students achieve this outcome.  
  
Through aqua exercise and activity classes, social squads, MATE programs and Rainbow Clubs for people with disabilities. Access and Inclusion services aim to provide learning pathways for our diverse population and communities.

## Join Access and Inclusion

For more information on the Access and Inclusion program or to express your interest and lock in your preferred lesson time please complete an enquiry form [HERE](/learn-to-swim/enrolment). 

## Access and Inclusion Educational Approach

This program adopts an educational approach and provides aquatic outcomes to ensure access and inclusion to all people regardless of:

  * Age
  * Disability
  * Chronic condition
  * Culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (CALD)



We aim to provide support for anyone who requires additional assistance or modified programs that will enable them to participate in aquatic related activities and programs. Programs that will be planned, developed and implemented based on the needs of an individual group.
