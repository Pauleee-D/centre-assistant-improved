While winter invites us to slow down, staying in swimming lessons keeps confidence growing. Maintaining your child’s enrolment during these colder months is crucial – not just for their skill progression, but for their safety and overall development. 

**Continuing lessons throughout winter offers numerous advantages:******

  * **Enhanced Physical Health****:** Regular swimming boosts cardiovascular fitness, strengthens muscles, and supports overall well-being. 
  * **Cognitive and Social Development****:** Swimming has been shown to aid in brain development, improving coordination, motor skills, balance, and concentration. It also provides opportunities for social interaction and teamwork. 
  * **Consistent Routine****:** Maintaining a regular schedule helps children develop discipline and a sense of normalcy, even during the colder months. 



**To ensure a comfortable and enjoyable swim lesson experience:**

  * **Dress Warmly** : Equip your child with appropriate clothing before and after lessons, including beanies and warm footwear. 
  * **Warm-Up Exercises****:** Engage in light stretches before entering the pool to increase blood flow and reduce injury risk. 
  * **Post-Lesson Care****:** Encourage a warm shower immediately after swimming to quickly restore body temperature. 



By prioritising swimming lessons during winter, you’re not only ensuring your child’s safety but also investing in a skill set which offers lifelong benefits. **Let’s work together to keep our children active, confident, and prepared in and around water – no matter the season.******

**It’s World Mental Health Day!**

World Mental Health Day is observed on 10 October each year as a global movement to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and encourage positive action for mental wellbeing. The day invites communities, workplaces, schools, and individuals to pause, reflect, and act in ways that strengthen social connection and mental health.

**About World Mental Health Day**

World Mental Health Day highlights that mental health is fundamental to overall health, and that small, everyday actions can make a big difference. It creates a shared moment for public education, personal reflection, and community-led activity that normalises conversations about mental wellbeing and encourages people to reach out for support when needed.

**This year’s theme is ‘Connect with your community’**

Mental Health Australia’s theme for World Mental Health Day is Connect with your community, encouraging everyone to connect with the communities that matter to them. Connecting with our communities can help us feel cared for and supported, which is good for our mental health.

The focus emphasises the protective power of social connection, the relationships, networks, and places where people feel safe, heard, and valued. Connection reduces loneliness, builds resilience, and strengthens our ability to cope with stress and adversity.

**Simple ways to take part**

  * Reach out to someone and start a genuine conversation.
  * Join a local group, event, or online community that shares an interest you enjoy.
  * Schedule a short walk, coffee, or phone call with a neighbour, friend, or colleague.
  * Volunteer or offer practical help to someone who may be isolated.
  * Share resources and honest messages about mental health to help reduce stigma.



**World Mental Health Day Calendar**

Mental Health Australia has also collaborated with ReachOut, one of Australia’s leading online mental health services for young people, to create a calendar and share daily tips for good mental health. Follow along the calendar and take a little time each day to prioritise your mental health!

This World Mental Health Day, take a small step and visit our venue!

Drop in, bring someone with you, exercise or simply spend time here to connect and prioritise your wellbeing.
