## Group Fitness Classes

If you love being a part of a community, our classes foster a great community environment that make you feel welcome, excited and keep you coming back for more.   
  
Catering to a range of ages and capabilities, we have classes ranging from strength-based through to wellness aimed at training your mind as well as the body. 

Group Fitness classes are a great way for you to stay motivated through accountability and social encouragement.
