# Aqua Aerobics

## 

## Aqua Aerobics Classes

Aqua aerobics is a great way to stay fit without aggravation or risking injury. Using the resistance of water automatically increases the intensity of any movement you make, helping to increase strength, flexibility and your overall health.  
  
It is similar to using weights or machines in a gym, however, aqua aerobics uses the natural buoyancy of the water to help protect the body from injury whilst exercising.

This also makes aqua aerobics fantastic for targeting particular areas of the body that require toning. 

### Current Aqua Aerobics Timetable

The aqua aerobics timetable is included in the [Group Fitness ](/getattachment/96e158cb-b741-4601-a15f-dbddf2c8701e/group-fitness-timetable-summer-swirl.pdf?lang=en-au)Timetable.

### The Benefits of Aqua Aerobics 

Water aerobics assists in the management of injuries and rehabilitation, allowing you to exercise the body without putting stress on your joints.

Evidence supports the effectiveness of hydrotherapy for managing pain and stiffness, particularly back, hip, knee and shoulder pain. Including arthritis and other chronic and complex conditions which make it hard to move.

Swirl water aerobics classes are taken in a safe, friendly and relaxing environment. We are accommodating to all ages and abilities in our onsite swimming pools.​
