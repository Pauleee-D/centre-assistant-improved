**It’s World Mental Health Day!**

World Mental Health Day is observed on 10 October each year as a global movement to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and encourage positive action for mental wellbeing. The day invites communities, workplaces, schools, and individuals to pause, reflect, and act in ways that strengthen social connection and mental health.

**About World Mental Health Day**

World Mental Health Day highlights that mental health is fundamental to overall health, and that small, everyday actions can make a big difference. It creates a shared moment for public education, personal reflection, and community-led activity that normalises conversations about mental wellbeing and encourages people to reach out for support when needed.

**This year’s theme is ‘Connect with your community’**

Mental Health Australia’s theme for World Mental Health Day is Connect with your community, encouraging everyone to connect with the communities that matter to them. Connecting with our communities can help us feel cared for and supported, which is good for our mental health.

The focus emphasises the protective power of social connection, the relationships, networks, and places where people feel safe, heard, and valued. Connection reduces loneliness, builds resilience, and strengthens our ability to cope with stress and adversity.

**Simple ways to take part**

  * Reach out to someone and start a genuine conversation.
  * Join a local group, event, or online community that shares an interest you enjoy.
  * Schedule a short walk, coffee, or phone call with a neighbour, friend, or colleague.
  * Volunteer or offer practical help to someone who may be isolated.
  * Share resources and honest messages about mental health to help reduce stigma.



**World Mental Health Day Calendar**

Mental Health Australia has also collaborated with ReachOut, one of Australia’s leading online mental health services for young people, to create a calendar and share daily tips for good mental health. Follow along the calendar and take a little time each day to prioritise your mental health!

This World Mental Health Day, take a small step and visit our venue!

Drop in, bring someone with you, exercise or simply spend time here to connect and prioritise your wellbeing.

Skip to content

More than 100 young women aged 12–18 across the Yarra Ranges have taken part in the first She Moves campaign to be delivered in the region, helping teen girls discover fun, inclusive and affordable ways to get active.

Designed to make wellness accessible and confidence-building, the Belgravia Leisure led She Moves program brought together 10 local partners and venues, hosting 31 sessions across the region. The community’s response was overwhelmingly positive, with participants describing sessions as “amazing,” “really good,” and “super fun!”.

Delivered over four weeks, the program offered girls the chance to try everything from yoga, dance and Pilates to soccer, basketball, mindfulness and self-care.

The campaign also celebrated local role models, including former WNBL player and two-time SEABL Champion Sarah Parsons, who coached the basketball clinic at Mt Lilydale Lakers.

“Creating a space where young girls could try something new, connect with others and feel supported was at the heart of this campaign,” Kelly said. “Programs like this are so important because they don’t just promote physical health, they build confidence, connection and a sense of belonging that can have a lasting impact.”

The success of She Moves has already sparked interest from new community partners for future years, setting the stage for the program’s continued growth and expansion.

Monbulk Aquatic Centre would like to acknowledge the support of Access Community Health and Yarra Ranges Council, whose collaboration helped make this first year such a success.

## Women’s Health Week 2025

It’s Women’s Health Week 2025! From the 1st – 5th of September 2025, we are focussing on the health and wellbeing of all women. This year the theme of Women’s Health Week is ‘Say Yes to You’, a powerful reminder that prioritising your health begins with movement that feels right for you. Whether small or bold, every choice to move supports your physical, mental, and social wellbeing.

Read more about the health tips to follow this week from our Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow, and our Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor.

### Top tips to stay on top of your health

Every woman’s health journey is unique and deserves personalised care that reflects her own goals, experiences, and needs. Supporting women to embrace their individual path is key to true wellbeing. Moving more doesn’t have to mean hours at the gym or strict workout schedules. It can be simple, enjoyable, and seamlessly woven into daily life. For example:  
• Taking a brisk walk during your lunch break  
• Choosing the stairs instead of the lift  
• Playing a social round of golf or sport with friends  
• Recharging with an active weekend away glamping, hiking, or cycling

Every step is an investment in your wellbeing, lifting energy, boosting mood, and strengthening your connection to yourself and others.

Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor

### Why is exercise so important?

Recent research shows that walking just 7,000 steps a day can cut the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, and depression, while lowering the chance of early death by up to 47%*.

This benchmark offers nearly the same benefits as the traditional 10,000-step goal, making it a realistic, sustainable target for busy women who often don’t have time to say yes to themselves. Choose movement that feels right for you.

Whether it’s a gentle stroll, a lively group class, a team sport, or an outdoor adventure, your health journey should reflect your lifestyle, preferences, and needs.

Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow

### Say Yes to You, Say Yes to Movement

This Women’s Health Week, saying yes to you means making some time for yourself and trying to add some movement. Being active energises, restores, and empowers. Whether it’s a short walk, a social sport, or an adventurous weekend away, moving your body is one of the most powerful acts of self-care you can give yourself. Say yes to you because every choice to move is an investment in your health and happiness!
