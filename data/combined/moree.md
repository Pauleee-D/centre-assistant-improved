**CENTRE UPDATE - TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION WORKS**

MOREE ARTESIAN AQUATIC CENTRE

We currently have one Artesian Hot pool available.  
  
Our Program Pool is closed for repairs and constuction is continuing on two additional thermal Pools. 

  
If you have any questions regarding the construction/refurbishment of the facility please email  
council@mpsc.nsw.gov.au or phone (02) 6757 3222 for further information.  
  
We look foward to seeing you soon  
MAAC Team

**ONLY ONE ARTESIAN POOL OPEN**

Due to the recent damage identified relating to structural issues of TWO of our pools at the MAAC that may compromise safety, the decision has been made to close these two pools until an independent safety inspection can be undertaken.  
  
We understand the frustrations and inconvenience this has caused to our members and guests of the facility. We are trying our best to accommodate for people to continue to use the centre in a safe environment and would appreciate an understanding while we work around this newly identified issue.  
  
We are keeping the other Artesian pool at a constant 40°, for a safe bathing temperature to cater for all types of patrons to continue to use the wellness pool while we aim for a temperature of 30° for the program pool to enable pool users to continue their aqua fitness.  
  
We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused pool users who enjoy the extra warm temperature of the hot active pool. We are all working towards getting this situation rectified as quickly as possible.  
  
We will provide an update on the progress of these works as more information is made available.

## Artesian Wellness Bathing

The famous Moree Hot Mineral Baths originated in 1895, when the baths mercurial waters were accidentally discovered. While searching for a reliable source of irrigation water, a bore was sunk into the Great Artesian Basin. Amazingly, this bore derived hot mineral waters, heated naturally at 41 degrees Celsius.

The baths are visited by 300,000 people annually, who travel to experience the therapeutic benefits.

# Aquatic Supervision

**Parents Supervise, Lifeguards Save Lives**

Your safety is very important to us and while there are lifeguards on hand, we ask you to follow these steps to help ensure your safety in and around our aquatic areas. 

## 

## Royal Lifesaving Keep Watch Policy

For over 20 years Keep Watch has been educating Australian parents and carers on how to keep their children safe when in, on or around the water.

Drowning is one of the leading causes of death in children 0–4 years of age.

The Keep Watch program has four key drowning prevention Actions. These should not be used individually but together to maximise child safety – if one line of defence fails, the other prevention measures will be actively working to prevent your child from drowning.

**Active supervision** at public pools consists of four key elements:

  * **Be Prepared** : Ensure you have everything you need before getting into the water, such as towels and dry clothes.
  * **Be Close** : Always be within arms' reach of your child.
  * **All of Your Attention** : Focus all of your attention on your child and get into the pool and talk and play with them.
  * **All of the Time** : You should never leave your child alone in the water, nor should they be left in the care of an older child or with the assumption that your responsibility diminishes due to the presence of lifeguards.



#### Supervision Policies:

## Weak/Non-Swimmer Policy

  * Tell a staff member if you are a Non-Swimmer, we’re here to help!
  * It’s ok to admit you are a non-swimmer, be recognised and survive
  * Wear a water safety orange wrist band while in the water to be recognised by lifeguards
  * Swim within safe depths according to your ability
  * Never swim in deep water if you are a Non-Swimmer
  * Be aware of drop zones in pools and abrupt depth change areas
  * Swim with a friend or companion

**Please note:** Lifeguards are employed on a 1:100 ratio; to help lifeguards supervise more effectively please advise staff if you are a non-swimmer, wear your wrist band and stay within safe depths commensurate with your ability.  
  
If you wish to improve your swimming ability to be safe in and around water, please contact us.

  * How you can embrace active wellbeing this Global Wellness Day 



# How you can embrace active wellbeing this Global Wellness Day 

14 Jun 2025 

Venue

Our individual health and wellbeing are paramount to enjoying a fulfilled life alongside our loved ones, engaging in countless valuable experiences to remember. This Global Wellness Day, we’re taking a closer look at how being more active, no matter your circumstance or ability, can positively boost your health and enjoyment of life.   
  
**What is Global Wellness Day?**   
Celebrated on Saturday 14 June 2025, Global Wellness Day encourages all to reflect, recognise and consider how we can live a healthier and better life. It is a day to: 

  * Recognise the value of our lives 
  * Pause and think, even if for just one day of the year 
  * Consider healthy ways to relieve the stress of everyday life or change bad habits 
  * Make peace with ourselves 
  * Raise awareness about living well and increasing motivation, not just for today, but for the remaining 364 days of the year 

We’re always looking for new ways to support your health and wellbeing. As part of Global Wellness Day, we’ve taken a look at some exciting industry trends. Whether you're just starting out or looking to try something new, these ideas might inspire you—or someone you care about—to take the next step in your wellness journey.   
  
**Wellness is for everyone**   
The team behind Global Wellness Day state that _‘Everyone has the right to live well…so the doors of Global Wellness Day are open to everyone’._ This ethos is lived and breathed by our team every day as we continue to promote social inclusion and participation by all. We encourage everyone to enjoy active wellbeing, irrespective of any personal circumstance. This can be in so many forms, allowing us ALL to improve our health, happiness and wellness together.   
  
**Supporting women through life stage transitions**   
Menopause and perimenopause are finally getting the attention they deserve—and we’re here for it. As bodies change, movement matters more than ever. Strength training can help maintain energy, bone health, and confidence. By normalising these conversations in our community spaces, we break down stigma and empower women to maintain strength and vitality through every life stage transition.   
  
**Building foundational strength for longevity**   
For middle-aged and older adults, leg strength is essential and supports us to walk further, allowing more opportunity and confidence to participate in general or physical social activities. It’s not just about adding years to one’s lifespan but about enhancing active wellbeing and improving one’s ‘health span’. A landmark study from the European Heart Journal found that poor leg strength in middle-aged and older adults was linked to a 50-60% higher risk of death. Participating in cardio exercises, whether that be on-land or in water can help these groups to build muscle power, supporting independence and a richer social life.   
  
**Exercise Physiology and Recovery**   
One in two Australians lives with chronic disease or ongoing injury, according to the 2022 National Health Survey. With a belief that “exercise is medicine”, Exercise Physiology is a growing service providing comprehensive assessments, individual goal setting and tailored interventions designed with the client at heart. Accredited exercise physiologists work alongside individuals, helping them to manage chronic conditions, rehabilitate injuries and embed safe, effective movement strategies into their active wellbeing journey.   
  
Recovery is also a growing space, with many Australians now relying on wearable trackers and sleep apps to keep an eye on rest and readiness to train. Recovery routines can vary from participation in yoga classes, attending recovery clinics with breath work and sound bath classes, or engaging in foam rolling sessions, massage chairs, massage guns and much more. Dedicating time to recovery means avoiding burnout, reducing injury risk and improving resilience.   
  
**Together we move more**   
We believe wellbeing is a journey that thrives and is best enjoyed when shared and connected, and our team are here to support you. If you would like to learn more about how particular programs or experiences may benefit your individual wellbeing, we welcome you to speak to a member of our team on your next visit or submit an enquiry.   
  
Find out how you can learn more about holistic health, mental resilience and the power of community this Global Wellness Day at [www.globalwellnessday.org](https://www.globalwellnessday.org/)

# Swim Champs

## Swim Champs Swimming Lessons

Swim Champs is a program designed for children from one year of age through to adults with specials needs. Swimming can be fantastic for children with special needs!  
  
The program is designed to assist students in building greater muscle strength and physical endurance. It also helps with increased flexibility, self-control and water safety. 

## Swimming Lessons Structure 

Group swimming lessons are ideal for the development of student’s social skills. We aim to have a maximum of three children in each class with a qualified instructor.  
  
Where possible we try to group the students in lessons with similar disabilities which is a great way for students to participate in lesson with friends they may already have or to make new ones!

## Join Us

Swimming is an essential and life-saving skill that you have for life. To sign up or enquire please complete an enquiry form on our contact page. 

## Children with Special Needs

Children with special needs can potentially be over confident around water and may lack an understanding of the dangers surrounding water environments. Swim Champs swimming lessons can provide important skills to assist in minimising these dangers.  
  
Lessons are conducted where ever possible as a group lesson structure. Swimming is a great leveler and can help children with special needs have fun in a non-competitive environment.
