Leadership of the future is creating environments that are safe and inclusive, and foster people to bring their whole selves to work. Having this investment in leadership is a wonderful offering. 

Anna LivingstonChief People and Culture Officer, AIA Australia

It’s something that really resonates with me, and what we’re doing with our team members on site at the moment - working through the mental health continuum and how we can make sure everyone’s looking after themselves. 

Vikki VenablesDC Manager Laverton CDC, Coles

Some of the things we learnt today around being able to understand when you aren't showing up as your best self, what have those triggers been, how can you help regulate yourself when you aren't feeling at your best, what are some of the tools in the toolbox that you can draw into to help show up in a more positive way for yourself as a leader but also for your team members to really role model that positive behaviour.

# Danny Frawley Centre partners with ISN to launch ISN Clinic at DFC

  * [ February 27, 2024  ](https://www.dannyfrawleycentre.com.au/2024/02/27/)
  * [News](https://www.dannyfrawleycentre.com.au/topic/news/)



The Danny Frawley Centre is pleased to announce the launch of DFC Psychology in partnership with the Institute of Social Neuroscience (ISN), providing accessible and essential psychological services to the community to further the centre’s impact and influence.

As the demand for mental health support continues to grow across Australia, this crucial partnership marks a significant move towards breaking down the barriers the community is currently facing.

According to statistics (provided by __Mental Health Australia_ , 2023 Report_), more than half of Australians aged 14 and above encountered obstacles when seeking mental health assistance last year.

Furthermore, the strain on mental health services continues to grow, with 1 in 3 psychologists across the country unable to see new clients. It’s a stark increase from pre-pandemic years when the same statistic sat at 1 in 100.

Chelsea Frawley, Danny’s eldest daughter and Head of Community and Operations at the Danny Frawley Centre, said she was excited to see the benefits of the new partnership take shape.

“We are thrilled to announce our partnership with ISN and bring to life our psychology space at the DFC,” Frawley said.

“This has been a project we have worked towards since the inception of the Centre. Finally being able to offer these low to no-cost services to those in need is something we are proud of.

“Dad always encouraged individuals facing challenges to seek help, including reaching out to mental health professionals. It’s because of his courage that many more people are now seeking assistance. We are proud to introduce these services, which will help mitigate the current barriers to accessing psychology.”

In addition to providing low to no-cost services run from the Danny Frawley Centre, the partnership with ISN will play a crucial role in developing a cohort of future qualified mental health professionals.

Staffed by provisional psychologists undergoing their initial placement as part of their Master’s or Doctoral degree program at ISN, the newly established clinic focuses on delivering top-tier, evidence-based interventions.

This program, which aims to cater for early intervention (including mental health illnesses such as depression and anxiety) and preventative mental health needs, will allow these sessions to be at low to no-cost for the community, while also addressing the nation-wide psychologist shortage. Registered psychologists will also be on-site to oversee the program, with these psychologists available to the public via a referral from a doctor or private booking.

“ISN psychology services at the DFC are for everyone. ISN Clinic’s partnership with the Danny Frawley Centre will look to break down the financial barriers to mental health support, which is crucial given not only the shortage of psychologists but also the current cost of living crisis,” ISN Chief Executive Officer Dr Tony Paolini said.

Today’s announcement coincides with the confirmation of Spud’s Game for 2024, which has been moved to the big stage for a prime-time, Thursday night blockbuster against Collingwood at the MCG.

This year’s game will again raise crucial funds to support the Danny Frawley Centre’s numerous physical and mental health initiatives and programs.
