## Aqua Aerobics

Aqua aerobics classes at Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool offer you a great way to stay fit without aggravation or risking injury. The resistance of water within each exercise and movement increases the intensity of your workout, helping to improve your strength, flexibility and overall health.

Classes are similar to using weights or machines in a gym; however, being in the water gives you a natural buoyancy to help protect and target particular areas of your body that require attention. Workouts address the entire body, helping to build strength and muscular endurance. Classes are great for cardiovascular health, improving fitness and stamina. Many people find Aqua Aerobics a fantastic stress reliever, feeling calmer after their workout.

Aqua Aerobics Classes run for [45 mins] and are instructed by qualified instructors with many years of experience. Aqua Aerobics Classes are included in our Full Access membership or available as casual class passes.

## Page 7: https://www.jackhortmcp.com.au/increasing-accessibility-at-jack-hort-memorial-community-pool-with-our-new-platypus-pool-steps/

Skip to content

Our Healesville community will soon be stepping into the excitement here at Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool, which will be fitted with new accessible Platypus Pool Steps thanks to an $11,999 grant through the Australian Government’s Stronger Communities Program (Round 9). 

Installation is planned for completion by the end of 2025, ensuring the pool remains a welcoming hub for our Healesville community for years to come. 

Yarra Ranges Mayor, Jim Child, shared: 

“Council is really pleased to see this upgrade coming to the Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool. The new steps will greatly improve accessibility for all members of the community and will help ensure the pool remains a safe and inclusive place for everyone, enabling seniors, people with disabilities, families and children to enjoy the health and social benefits of swimming. 

“This project is a great example of how we’re working with our partners to enhance community wellbeing and inclusivity through our aquatic facilities.” 

We know that communities with healthy, engaged citizens contribute more positively to society. Its residents live longer, live with freedom and have less mental health issues. This is why it is important for us to create programs that benefit every member of the community, young and old and of any ability. 

Kelly Parker, Community Engagement Coordinator here at the venue, also spoke about the benefits that the accessible Platypus Pool Steps will bring. 

“We are very excited to have received the Aaron Violi Stronger Community’s Programme grant, this important addition will make a real difference for our ageing community members, who currently face challenges accessing the pool. 

“By improving accessibility, we are removing barriers to participation and ensuring Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool is a more inclusive space for all.” 

Belgravia Leisure and Belgravia Foundation are proud to support this upgrade, helping more people in our community enjoy safe and comfortable access to the pool. Jeff Walkley said, “Improved accessibility has a cascading impact, creating overcoming barriers to participate in experiences that not only impact physical health, but build a sense of belonging, create new and deepen existing social connections, and enrich lives through renewed optimism and a sense of purpose.” 

Visit us at Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool to see accessibility in action and stay up to date with developments on these steps on our news page.

# About Us

## Our Story

Jack Hort Memorial Community Pool is your local indoor swimming and aquatic centre located in Healesville, Victoria.

The Pool was cooperatively built by the (then) Healesville Shire, Healesville High School and the Rotary Club of Healesville. Community members and tradespeople assisted in planning, fundraising, construction, painting and outfitting.

Opened in 1990, the pool was able to able to built for less than half the estimated cost of 1.2 million dollars. In 2006 the pool was renamed to commemorate the late Jack Hort, a driving force since the pool’s inception.

Yarra Ranges Council commits a substantial amount annually to assist with supporting running costs. Ongoing funding comes from pool user fees, Healesville High School, Support Healesville Indoor Pool (SHIP) group and generous corporate and public donations.

​Thousands of people of all ages and abilities from throughout the Yarra Valley are able to use the pool year round for recreation, rehabilitation, water familiarisation, skill development, training and perhaps most importantly enjoyment.

Come in and visit us today! We look forward to providing you with the best health and leisure experiences possible.
