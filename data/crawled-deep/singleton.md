# Developmental Squads

## 

## GOswim Academy Program

  
Developed in partnership with industry experts, GOswim Academy forms a part of the GOswim program. Helping kids across Australia develop their swimming skills at a pace that’s right for them. Here at Singleton Gym & Swim we want to increase participation in swimming in a fun and engaging way!

Research has revealed that thousands of kids stop swimming because it stops being fun. Industry experts and the GOswim Academy program have developed a mixture of offerings to encourage continued participation in aquatic activity through competitive and reactional lap swimming.

This is an exciting program where kids across Australia can have fun with their friends and improve their swimming in a safe, social and non-competitive environment.  
  
Aimed at kids who have already learnt the basics of swimming, GOswim Academy is designed for students aged between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. It’s perfect for kids ready for junior squads, or for those who are interested in getting ready for the competitive swimming club environment.
