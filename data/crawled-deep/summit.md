## Women’s Health Week 2025

It’s Women’s Health Week 2025! From the 1st – 5th of September 2025, we are focussing on the health and wellbeing of all women. This year the theme of Women’s Health Week is ‘Say Yes to You’, a powerful reminder that prioritising your health begins with movement that feels right for you. Whether small or bold, every choice to move supports your physical, mental, and social wellbeing.

Read more about the health tips to follow this week from our Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow, and our Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor.

### Top tips to stay on top of your health

Every woman’s health journey is unique and deserves personalised care that reflects her own goals, experiences, and needs. Supporting women to embrace their individual path is key to true wellbeing. Moving more doesn’t have to mean hours at the gym or strict workout schedules. It can be simple, enjoyable, and seamlessly woven into daily life. For example:  
• Taking a brisk walk during your lunch break  
• Choosing the stairs instead of the lift  
• Playing a social round of golf or sport with friends  
• Recharging with an active weekend away glamping, hiking, or cycling

Every step is an investment in your wellbeing, lifting energy, boosting mood, and strengthening your connection to yourself and others.

Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor

### Why is exercise so important?

Recent research shows that walking just 7,000 steps a day can cut the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, and depression, while lowering the chance of early death by up to 47%*.

This benchmark offers nearly the same benefits as the traditional 10,000-step goal, making it a realistic, sustainable target for busy women who often don’t have time to say yes to themselves. Choose movement that feels right for you.

Whether it’s a gentle stroll, a lively group class, a team sport, or an outdoor adventure, your health journey should reflect your lifestyle, preferences, and needs.

Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow

### Say Yes to You, Say Yes to Movement

This Women’s Health Week, saying yes to you means making some time for yourself and trying to add some movement. Being active energises, restores, and empowers. Whether it’s a short walk, a social sport, or an adventurous weekend away, moving your body is one of the most powerful acts of self-care you can give yourself. Say yes to you because every choice to move is an investment in your health and happiness!
