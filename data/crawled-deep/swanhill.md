# Aquatic Fun Days

## Aquatic Fun Days

Our aquatic centre is the perfect place to keep children entertained.  
  
Our Aquatic Fun Days are terrific at getting kids excited for learning to swim and become more confident in the water.  
  
A day out at your local aquatic centre is already an abundance of fun for the kids as well as an affordable family outing.  
  
Combine that with our aquatic fun days and the kids will be bursting with excitement.

### Aquatic Fun Days For Schools 

Engage your students and reward them for their efforts and achievements throughout the year.  
  
Whether it be for an end of term reward, end of year activity or a Grade 6 Graduation celebration day. We will design a program to accommodate the needs of all students.

Please remember to always keep watch over your children when in and around the water.

  * Aquatic Supervision 



# Aquatic Supervision

**Your Safety**

Your safety is very important to us and while there are Lifeguards on hand we ask you to follow these steps to help ensure your safety in and around our aquatic areas. 

## 

## **Watch Around Water**

Swan Hill Aquatic & Recreation Centre is a Watch Around Water facility. This program was developed by Aquatics & Recreation Victoria and Life Saving Victoria to:

  * educate the public about adequate supervision
  * encourage parent/guardians to take on this responsibility when visiting a public aquatic facility.



​Therefore, the following safe supervision policies must be adhered to:

### **Children Under 5 Years Old**

  * Will be issued a pink wristband from reception upon entry.
  * Children under 5 years old must be constantly supervised by a parent/guardian.
  * Adequate supervision requires the parent/guardian to accompany the child in the water and remain within arm's reach of the child at all times.



### **Children Under 10 Years Old**

  * Children under 10 years old will not be admitted without an appropriate parent/guardian. The parent/guardian must be 16 years or over and adhere to all conditions of entry.
  * Children under 10 years old must be constantly supervised by a parent/guardian while in the aquatic area of the centre.
  * The parent/guardian must position himself or herself to have a clear view of the child with no physical or structural barriers between them and the child.



### **Children 10 Years and Older**

  * For children 10 years and older, parents must use their knowledge of the child's swimming ability to determine the level of supervision required.
  * Parent /guardians are not required to be present in the centre.



## **Weak/Non-Swimmer Policy**

  * Tell a staff member if you are a Non-Swimmer, we’re here to help!
  * It’s ok to admit you are a non-swimmer, be recognised and survive
  * Wear a water safety orange wrist band while in the water to be recognised by lifeguards
  * Swim within safe depths according to your ability
  * Never swim in deep water if you are a Non-Swimmer
  * Be aware of drop zones in pools and abrupt depth change areas
  * Swim with a friend or companion

**Please note:** Lifeguards are employed on a 1:100 ratio; to help lifeguards supervise more effectively please advise staff if you are a non-swimmer, wear your wrist band and stay within safe depths commensurate with your ability.  
  
For copy of this policy in Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, Arabic or Sudanese-Arabic [Click Here](/getattachment/swim/what-you-need-to-know/waw-weak-non-swimmer/non_swimmer_poster_languages.pdf?lang=en-au).

## Swimming Program for Older Adults

Designed exclusively for senior members of our community, our Grey Medallion program can help you lead a healthy, independent and active lifestyle. You’ll learn all the essential skills you need to safely enjoy your aquatic and recreation activities.  
  
You’ll gain knowledge in personal survival techniques and benefit from improved swimming skills. Also, gain an understanding of how to deal with emergency situations, and obtain critical water safety practices to give you peace of mind and confidence when enjoying the water. Main components include:

  * Water safety knowledge
  * Resuscitation and emergency care
  * Aquatic exercise
  * Personal survival and lifesaving skills



Classes will run for 30 minutes [contact our friendly team](/contact-us/get-in-touch) or visit us at reception.

### Join Grey Medallion

Swimming and water safety skills are essential and lifesaving skills that you have for life. Click below to join us.

[ Enrol ](/learn-to-swim/enrolment) [ Contact Us ](/contact-us/get-in-touch)

##  Grey Medallion Program Expand all 

#####  Resuscitation and Emergency Care 

Knowing what to do in an emergency situation will more likely result in a positive outcome. The first person on the scene of an emergency is most often a family member so you could one day find yourself needing to provide resuscitation or emergency care. Ask yourself, would you know what to do?  
  
This module aims to teach the following:

  * Recognising an emergency
  * Understanding resuscitation and when it’s required
  * DRSABCD action plan
  * Aftercare



#####  Aquatic Exercise 

Aquatic exercise is ideal for older adults because of its low impact nature making it suitable for both active people and those with restricted mobility.  
  
Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of heart attack, improve blood cholesterol, lower blood pressure and even help to prevent falls and injury. Sessions will aim to further develop your swimming skills in a fun and non-threatening way and is tailored to cater for a range of abilities.

**Included may be the following activities:**

  * Water movement skills
  * Gentle exercise
  * Correct swimming techniques
  * Exercise to improve endurance and fitness levels



#####  Personal Survival and Lifesaving Skills 

Lifesaving skills are not just for those at the local pool or beach. Everybody should have some essential personal survival techniques and basic rescue skills. You never know when these skills may need to be put into practice either to ensure your own safety or to assist somebody else in trouble.

Skills taught will include:

  * Safe entries and exits
  * Survival techniques and strategies
  * Rescue principles
  * Non-swimming rescues
