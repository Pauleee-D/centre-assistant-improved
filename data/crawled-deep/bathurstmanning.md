## Women’s Health Week 2025

It’s Women’s Health Week 2025! From the 1st – 5th of September 2025, we are focussing on the health and wellbeing of all women. This year the theme of Women’s Health Week is ‘Say Yes to You’, a powerful reminder that prioritising your health begins with movement that feels right for you. Whether small or bold, every choice to move supports your physical, mental, and social wellbeing.

Read more about the health tips to follow this week from our Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow, and our Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor.

### Top tips to stay on top of your health

Every woman’s health journey is unique and deserves personalised care that reflects her own goals, experiences, and needs. Supporting women to embrace their individual path is key to true wellbeing. Moving more doesn’t have to mean hours at the gym or strict workout schedules. It can be simple, enjoyable, and seamlessly woven into daily life. For example:  
• Taking a brisk walk during your lunch break  
• Choosing the stairs instead of the lift  
• Playing a social round of golf or sport with friends  
• Recharging with an active weekend away glamping, hiking, or cycling

Every step is an investment in your wellbeing, lifting energy, boosting mood, and strengthening your connection to yourself and others.

Allied Health Manager, Kia Naylor

### Why is exercise so important?

Recent research shows that walking just 7,000 steps a day can cut the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, and depression, while lowering the chance of early death by up to 47%*.

This benchmark offers nearly the same benefits as the traditional 10,000-step goal, making it a realistic, sustainable target for busy women who often don’t have time to say yes to themselves. Choose movement that feels right for you.

Whether it’s a gentle stroll, a lively group class, a team sport, or an outdoor adventure, your health journey should reflect your lifestyle, preferences, and needs.

Group Health and Wellbeing Manager, Victoria Goodwin-Barlow

### Say Yes to You, Say Yes to Movement

This Women’s Health Week, saying yes to you means making some time for yourself and trying to add some movement. Being active energises, restores, and empowers. Whether it’s a short walk, a social sport, or an adventurous weekend away, moving your body is one of the most powerful acts of self-care you can give yourself. Say yes to you because every choice to move is an investment in your health and happiness!

# Aqua Aerobics

## **Aqua Aerobics**

Aqua aerobics classes at Manning Aquatic Centre Bathurst offer you a great way to stay fit without aggravation or risking injury. The resistance of water within each exercise and movement increases the intensity of your workout, helping to improve your strength, flexibility and overall health.

Classes are similar to using weights or machines in a gym; however, being in the water gives you a natural buoyancy to help protect and target particular areas of your body that require attention. Workouts address the entire body, helping to build strength and muscular endurance. Classes are great for cardiovascular health, improving fitness and stamina. Many people find Aqua Aerobics a fantastic stress reliever, feeling calmer after their workout.

Aqua Aerobics Classes run for 45 minutes and are instructed by qualified instructors with many years of experience. Aqua Aerobics Classes are included in our Full Access membership or available as casual class passes.
